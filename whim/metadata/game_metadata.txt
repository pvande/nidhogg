# === Flags available at all licensing tiers ===

# Defines the render scale quality for sprites. scale_quality=0 (default) is nearest neighbor, scale_quality=1 is linear, scale_quality=2 is antialiased.
# - 0: pixel perfect scaling (use this if your game uses pixel-art)
# - 1: less blocky visuals,
# - 2: higher computational overhead than linear, but provides the best visual quality
# scale_quality=0

# A comma delimited list of directories that should be ignored during the
# publishing process. For example, if your game supports saves, you'd want to ignore
# that directory (example format: ignore_directories=tmp,saves,dev,assets).
#   IMPORTANT:
#   Any directory that matches the ignore list will be ignored (REGARDLESS OF HIERARCHY).
#   For example:
#     ignore_directories value: saves
#     Directory structure:
#     - mygame
#       - saves <---- This directory will be ignored
#       - libs
#         - saves <---- This directory will be ignored
# ignore_directories=saves


# === Flags available in DragonRuby Game Toolkit Pro ====

# Uncomment the entry below to bytecode compile your Ruby code
compile_ruby=true

# Uncomment the entry below to specify the package name for your APK
# packageid=org.dev.gamename

# Setting this property to true will enable High DPI rendering (try in combination with scale_quality to see what looks best)
highdpi=true

# === Orientation Portrait/Landscape ===
# The orientation can be set to either landscape (1280x720) or portrait (720x1280). The default is ~landscape~.
# orientation=landscape

# === Orientation Override for Mobile ==
# You can override the orientation of your game for mobile devices. If this value isn't provided, it which will use
# the value from ~orientation=~. Valid values for the override are portrait, or landscape
# orientation_android=inherit
# orientation_ios=inherit

# === HD Mode ===
# HD Mode: when enabled, will give you 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4k, and 5k rendering options
# Check out the following YouTube Video for a demo of DragonRuby's HD Capabilities
# https://youtu.be/Rnc6z84zaa4
hd=true

# === Texture Atlases ===
# See sample app for texture atlas usage: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering_hd/02_texture_atlases=
# DragonRuby will recursively search the following directory for texture atlases.
# sprites_directory=sprites

# === All Screen Mode ===
# To render edge to edge on the device, set hd_letterbox=false
# NOTE: remove your game's letter box will mean more work for you since you have to
#       think about what you want to render outside of the games main 1280x720 logical
#       area.
hd_letterbox=false

# === Scaling options for All Screen Mode ===
# You can specify the maximum scale for your game. hd_max_scale's default value is 0 which
# means "stretch to fit" (while retaining a 16:9 aspect ratio). This scaling method is not
# pixel perfect, but is a reasonable default for most games.
# hd_max_scale=0

# hd_max_scale values other than 0 *will* be pixel perfect. Resolutions higher than your max scale
# will give more area outside of your safe area that can be rendered to (if hd_letterbox=false)
# or give you a bigger letterbox (if hd_letterbox=true).
# Example:
#   - Assuming that the hd_max_scale=1 (which means a game max scale of 1280x720) and hd_letterbox=false...
#   - If the screen size is 2560x1440...
#   - The safe area of the game will be rendered at 1280x720 centered vertically and horizontally within 2560x1440.
#   - The horizontal centering of the game will mean that you have 640 pixels to the left and 640 pixels to the right of the game's safe area to render to.
#   - The vertical centering of the game will mean that you have 360 pixels above and 360 below the game's safe area to render to.
#
# Take a look at the following sample apps to see how updating hd_max_scale and hd_letterbox affects your game:
#   - ./samples/07_advanced_rendering_hd/03_allscreen_properties
#   - ./samples/99_genre_platformer/clepto_frog
#   - ./samples/99_genre_platformer/the_little_probe

# Available hd_max_scale values (other than hd_max_scale=0 which is described above)
# 720p: Scales up to 1280x720
hd_max_scale=100

# HD+: scales up to 1600x900
# hd_max_scale=125

# 1080p/Full HD: scales up to 1920x1080
# hd_max_scale=150

# Full HD+: scales up to 2240x1260
# hd_max_scale=175

# 1440p: scales up to 2560x1440
# hd_max_scale=200

# 1800p: scales up to 3200x1800
# hd_max_scale=250

# 4k: scales up to 3840x2160
# hd_max_scale=300

# 5k: scales up to 6400x2880
# NOTE: If you want a pixel perfect game for all resolutions. You'll want to use hd_max_scale=400.
#       If you don't want to worry about rendering game artifacts outside of the pixel perfect area,
#       keep hd_letterbox=true.
# hd_max_scale=400
